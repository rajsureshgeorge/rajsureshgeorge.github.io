## Mimicking Is Where Learning Really Begins

Ever watched a baby try to speak? 
They don’t know what the words mean yet—but they *try*. 
They move their lips, copy the sounds, and imitate everything they see. 
It’s kind of beautiful, isn’t it?

That’s how we all started learning—by **mimicking**.

We weren’t taught through manuals or YouTube tutorials at first. 
We just watched, listened, and repeated. 
No pressure to be perfect. No fear of being “unoriginal.” 
Just pure curiosity and a natural urge to copy what we see.

> Just admitting that you learned by mimicking doesn’t cost a thing.
> There’s no shame in it.
> No weakness in it.
> No loss of pride.
>
> We all start somewhere—and more often than not, that “somewhere” is watching someone else and trying to do what they did. That’s not failure. That’s being human.
>
> So yes—just admit it.
> It doesn’t cost you anything.
> In fact, it might just remind someone else that they’re not alone either.

## Mimicking in My Personal Life

_Taking my own life as an example_, I can confidently say that everything I’ve learned so far began by simply watching someone else do it first.

I started using computers just because I saw someone else working on them. It intrigued me. The curiosity kicked in, and that little spark turned into a path I now genuinely love. Over the years, the things I used to just admire from a distance are now the very things I enjoy working on.

### How I Got Into Terminal Editors, Linux, and Computer Architecture

It all began with an old, rusty Dell laptop that my sister handed down to me.  
It was painfully slow—so slow that even moving the mouse felt like a task.  
That’s when the journey began.

I started looking for operating systems that were lightweight and could revive that dying machine. Countless Google searches and forum threads later, I discovered Linux.

And just like that, I was hooked.

I found myself diving deep into YouTube, watching all these “elite” Linux users fly through their terminals like wizards. It wasn’t just about using the computer—it was about **mastering** it. I admired it. I wanted to do that too.

So, I installed Linux. And then the real journey began.

Even today, after years of tinkering, learning, breaking, fixing, and discovering—I still consider myself a **noob**. But a happy noob, always learning.

Then came the next wave: Vim, Emacs, fzf, and so many other tools that now shape how I work and think. These tools weren’t easy at first. But again, I learned them the same way I started—by watching others, copying them, trying to understand their workflow, and eventually shaping my own.

### **All of this started because I mimicked others.**

That’s it.  
No fancy strategy. No perfect roadmap.  
Just pure curiosity, admiration, and the courage to try.

**Mimicking wasn’t a weakness, it was my launchpad.**  
And eventually, what began as copying became my own flow.

So if you’re just starting out and feel like all you’re doing is copying others—good.  
You’re right where you need to be.

Try to copy only the **GOOD** out of others.

## We Never Really Stop Mimicking

Fast forward to adulthood, and guess what? 
We’re still doing it.

Trying to learn guitar? You copy the chords someone else played. 

Learning to cook? You follow a recipe step-by-step. 

Picking up a new skill at work? You shadow a colleague or search how someone else did it.

It’s not lazy. It’s not uncreative. It’s **human**.

## Why Mimicking Isn’t a Bad Thing

There’s this weird pressure to be “original” from day one. 
But honestly? That’s not how it works.

Mimicking helps us:

- Understand what “good” looks like 
- Build confidence before experimenting 
- Lay the groundwork for something better

And eventually, without even realizing it, **we add our own twist**.
Our own rhythm. Our own voice.

That’s when the magic happens.
But it all starts with a little copying.

## Copy First. Create Later.

Every artist, every writer, every creator you admire?
They started by copying someone else.
And over time, they found their voice. Their way of doing things.

So if you’re in that phase right now—mimicking, repeating, just trying to get the hang of it—**that’s okay**.
More than okay. That’s how real learning begins.

Let go of the guilt. Embrace the process.

**MIMIC FREELY. LEARN DEEPLY. AND WHEN YOU’RE READY, YOU’LL FIND YOUR WAY.**
