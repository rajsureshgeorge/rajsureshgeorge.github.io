## Mimicking Is Where Learning Really Begins

Ever watched a baby trying to speak?  
They don’t know the words yet—but they *try*.  
They move their lips, copy sounds, and imitate everything they see.  
Beautiful, isn’t it?

That’s how we all started learning—by **mimicking**.

We weren’t taught through manuals or YouTube tutorials at first.  
We just watched, listened, and repeated.  
No pressure to be perfect. No fear of being “unoriginal.”  
Just pure curiosity and a natural urge to copy what we see.

> Just admitting that you learned by mimicking doesn’t cost a thing.  
> There’s no shame in it.  
> No weakness in it.  
> No loss of pride.  
>
> We all start somewhere—and more often than not, that “somewhere” is watching someone else and trying to do what they did. That’s not failure. That’s being human.  
>
> So yes—just admit it.  
> It doesn’t cost you anything.  
> In fact, it might just remind someone else that they’re not alone either.

## How Mimicking Shaped My Journey

_Taking my own life as an example_, I can confidently say that everything I’ve learned so far began by simply watching someone else do it first.

I started using computers just because I saw someone else working on them.  
It intrigued me. That curiosity turned into something I genuinely enjoy today.  
Over time, the things I once admired from a distance became the very things I now work on daily.

### How I Got Into Terminal Editors, Linux, and Computer Architecture

It all began with an old, rusty Dell laptop that my sister handed down to me.  
It was painfully slow—so slow that even moving the mouse felt like a task.

That’s when the journey began.

I started looking for operating systems that were lightweight and could revive that dying machine.  
Countless Google searches and forum threads later, I discovered **Linux**.

And just like that, I was hooked.

I stumbled upon YouTube videos of these *elite* Linux users flying through their terminals.  
It wasn’t just about using a computer—it was about **mastering** it.  
I admired that. I wanted to be like that.

So, I installed Linux. And then the real journey began.

Even today, after years of tinkering, learning, breaking, fixing, and exploring—I still consider myself a **noob**.  
But a happy noob, always learning.

Then came the next wave: **Vim**, **Emacs**, **fzf**, and so many other tools that now shape how I work and think.  
These tools weren’t easy at first. But again, I learned them the same way I started—by watching others, copying them, trying to understand their workflow, and eventually shaping my own.

### **All of this started because I mimicked others.**

That’s it.  
No fancy strategy. No perfect roadmap.  
Just pure curiosity, admiration, and the courage to try.

**Mimicking wasn’t a weakness—it was my launchpad.**  
And eventually, what began as copying became my own flow.

So if you’re just starting out and feel like all you’re doing is copying others—good.  
You’re right where you need to be.

**Try to take only the best from others.**

## We Never Really Stop Mimicking

Fast forward to adulthood, and guess what?  
We’re still doing it.

Trying to learn guitar? You copy the chords someone else played.  
Learning to cook? You follow a recipe step-by-step.  
Picking up a new skill at work? You shadow a colleague or look it up online.

It’s not lazy. It’s not uncreative.  
It’s **human**.

## Why Mimicking Isn’t a Bad Thing

There’s this weird pressure to be “original” from day one.  
But honestly? That’s not how it works.

Mimicking helps us:

- Understand what “good” looks like  
- Build confidence before experimenting  
- Lay the groundwork for something better

And eventually, without even realizing it, **we add our own twist**.  
Our own rhythm. Our own voice.

That’s when the magic happens.  
But it all starts with a little copying.

## Copy First. Create Later.

Every artist, every writer, every creator you admire?  
They started by copying someone else.  
And over time, they found their voice.  
Their way of doing things.

So if you’re in that phase right now—mimicking, repeating, just trying to get the hang of it—**that’s okay**.  
More than okay. That’s how real learning begins.

Let go of the guilt. Embrace the process.

**Mimic freely. Learn deeply. And when you’re ready, you’ll find your way.**

Thanks for reading.  
If you’ve ever felt guilty about learning by copying — I hope this gave you a little peace.  
We all start somewhere.

**What’s something you once mimicked that became your strength?**  
I’d love to hear your story in the comments.
