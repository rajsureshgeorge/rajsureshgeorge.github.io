## Show Differences in Unified Format

git diff `--`unified=(num)




## Show Differences with Word Granularity

# Git Pull Commands




## Pull Changes from the Default Remote and Branch

git pull




## Pull Changes from a Specific Remote and Branch

git pull (remote) (branch)




## Rebase Instead of Merge

git pull `--`rebase

> This command fetches changes from the remote and rebases your local commits on top of the fetched changes instead of merging them. This can help keep a linear history.




## Pull with Verbose Output

git pull `--`verbose




## Pull with Squash

git pull `--`squash

> This option prepares the changes from the remote branch for a single commit rather than merging them directly. You need to manually commit the squashed changes.

> This command specifies a merge strategy for integrating the fetched changes.




# Git Push Commands




## Push Changes to the Default Remote Branch

git push




## Push Changes to a Specific Remote and Branch

git push (remote) (branch)




## Push All Local Branches

git push `--`all




## Push Tags

git push `--`tags




## Push with Force

git push `--`force




## Push with Lease

git push `--`force-with-lease

> This command forces the push but only if your local branch is up-to-date with the remote branch. It helps prevent overwriting changes that others might have pushed.




## Push with a Specific Ref

git push (remote) (local-branch):(remote-branch)




## Push to Set Upstream Tracking

git push `--`set-upstream (remote) (branch)

> This command sets the specified remote branch as the upstream branch for the current local branch. It is useful for tracking branches and simplifying future push and pull commands.

## Merge Another Branch into Current Branch

git merge (branch-name)

> This command merges the specified branch into the current branch.

## Merge with No Fast-Forward

git merge `--`no-ff (branch-name)

> This command performs a merge without fast-forwarding, creating a merge commit even if the merge could be fast-forwarded. This is useful for keeping a record of the merge in the history.




## Merge with Squash

git merge `--`squash (branch-name)

> This command combines all the changes from the specified branch into a single commit. It does not create a merge commit but instead prepares the changes for a new commit.




## Merge with Strategy

git merge -s (strategy) (branch-name)

> This command specifies a merge strategy. Common strategies include recursive (default), ours, theirs, resolve, and octopus.




## Abort a Merge

git merge `--`abort

> If a merge conflict occurs and you decide not to continue with the merge, this command aborts the merge process and restores the working directory to the state before the merge.

> After resolving conflicts during a rebase, use this command to continue the rebase process.




## Skip a Commit During Rebase

git rebase `--`skip

> This command skips the current commit that caused conflicts and continues with the rebase.




## Abort a Rebase

git rebase `--`abort

> This command aborts the rebase process and returns your branch to its previous state before the rebase started.




## Rebase with Autosquash

git rebase `--`autosquash

> This command automatically squashes commits marked with fixup! or squash! in the interactive rebase session.




## Rebase with a Specific Strategy

git rebase -s (strategy)

> This command specifies a merge strategy for rebasing. Strategies include recursive, ours, theirs.




## Rebase with No-FF

git rebase `--`no-ff

> This command forces a rebase without fast-forwarding, creating a new commit even if the rebase could be fast-forwarded.

## Show Status with Verbose Output

git status `--`verbose




## Show Status with Short Format

git status `--`short

# Git Stash Commands
